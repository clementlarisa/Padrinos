                    <h1>Smino Unleashes Sophomore Album 'Noir' Featuring Valee and Dreezy: Listen</h1>


                    <p>Smino's second album Noir finally arrived on Thursday (Nov. 8), with the rapper strategically
                        opting
                        to have his project stand alone, rather than the traditional Friday release day that's usually
                        flooded with fresh tunes.</p>

                    <p>The 18-track LP enlists Ravyn Lenae, Chicago natives Valee and Dreezy, Bari, and Jay2 for assists
                        throughout the 59-minute effort. <q>Noir is a record about the present, about life now,</q>
                        Smino
                        previously told Billboard of his new album. <q>An experience that is far more complex and
                            challenging.</q></p>

                    <p>The St. Louis native returns home for his third-annual Kribmas show at The Pageant on Dec. 14.
                        Smino
                        rose to prominence with the release of his acclaimed soulful blkswn debut album in early 2017,
                        before going on to serve as an opener on SZA's CTRL Tour.The new music follows his 2017 breakout debut blkswn. "Noir is a record about the present."</p>

                    <h1>Michael Bublé Announces 2019 Tour Dates, Will Receive Star On the Hollywood Walk Of Fame</h1>


                    <p>Michael Bublé will be back on the road in 2019, the singer announced today (Nov. 8). Bublé’s
                        27-city
                        U.S. tour will begin on Feb. 13 in Tampa, Fla., and will wrap in Tacoma, Wash. on April 6.
                        Tickets
                        for the tour will be available Nov. 19.</p>

                    <q>I’m going to go back to what I was made to do,</q> Bublé said in a statement. <q>I’m going to
                    come back
                    to a world that needs love and romance and laughter more than it has in a long time. I’m going to be
                    a conduit to that. This is the greatest record I’ve ever made.</q>

                    <p>Bublé previously released "When I Fall in Love" and "Love You Anymore", two tracks off of the
                        upcoming album. Love is Bublé’s 10th studio album, following 2016’s Nobody but Me. Bublé took a
                        hiatus from music after his son Noah was diagnosed with cancer in 2016.</p>

                    <h1>Chris Garneau Wants to 'Wake People Up' With Sprawling New Album 'Yours': Premiere</h1>

                    <p>This Friday (Nov. 9), Garneau returns from a hiatus with his fourth album, Yours, which – like so
                        much of culture these days – is influenced by the increasingly dire circumstances the human race
                        finds itself in these days.</p>

                    <p><q>After a two-year break from recording and touring, I decided to start work on a new album with
                        my
                        good friend and bandmate Maxime Vavasseur in our co-producer’s Lyon studio,</q> Garneau says.
                        <q>I wrote
                            most of the material over the summer of 2016 and we began recording in October. I was
                            worried at
                            first that the material was too severely dismal — with narratives ranging from mass
                            incarceration
                            and industrialized slave labor to ones of abandonment, potential mass extinction, and death.
                            Then
                            the election happened and I decided to move forward regardless of my earlier
                            apprehension.</q></p>
